  "body": "### Background and context.\r\nWe have found an existing data set containing over 5000 data points for movies linked above. The data set contains 28 variables ranging from information such as the director name, main actors and the number of likes that each actor has on Facebook, the movie budget, genre, etc. The objective of our project is to create a program that will take user inputs for a movie and return an accurate imdb score for it. In order to do this, we will be running different statistical prediction models through Python packages such as scikit-learn and pandas.\r\n\r\nThe main learning goals for this project is to use machine learning to come up with a methodology to predict future IMDb scores, which ties to utilization of Python to build predictive models for data analytics. Moreover, our group wanted to familiarize ourselves with different library packages that are essential to data analytics and understand the difficulty in creating accurate models for predictions, and what factors affect the accuracy. Overall, since this is software development class, we wanted to develop the software that can integrate the aspects of machine learning and software development.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
