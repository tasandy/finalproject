#Predict the IMDb scores

##Team Ignus: Wayne Kwon, Jason Lee, Alyssa Wu, and Sandy |

###Background and context

To reiterate/as a reminder, our project is to create a program that will take user inputs for a movie and return an accurate imdb score range for it. In order to do this, we ran different statistical prediction models through Python packages such as scikit-learn and pandas. So far, our team has built out three different statistical models, including linear regression, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors, that could be used in determining movie score through Python and started to set up our software. We are using an existing dataset containing information on over 5,000 movies with variables such as actor Facebook likes, movie genres, budget, etc.


###Key questions
1. Website: What features do you expect the website to have?
  1. What would you think is helpful outside of the user inputs?
  2. Current Considerations:
    1. Based on our models, the variables that were selected and will be used for user inputs are facebook likes, number of user for reviews, budget, and genres

2. How can we transfer the user inputs to the model so that a prediction can be made?
  1. How to merge the codes that we built for the models and the codes for the software, which is the Website

3. In terms of software aspects, do you have any suggestions for extensions outside of just data science?
  1. Current Considerations:
    1. Movie recommendations

###Agenda
1. Background and context (3 minutes)
  1. Refresher
  2. Progress
2. Software (website) Ideation (8 minutes)
3. Key questions 1&2 (4 minutes each)

**Strategy**: To communicate with our audience, we will have a ideation session for our software development for 8 minutes and two key questions will come after.

**Notetaker**: Alyssa Wu
