           <p>Remember when movie tickets were only $10? Movie ticket prices have been on the rise and are currently priced at approximately $14 - not including popcorn and soda, which adds another $10. With a potential grand total of $24, it has become more necessary for us to make sure that we are watching a movie worth watching and spending so much money on.</p>
           <p>We have found an existing data set containing over 5000 data points for movies in Kaggle. The data set contains 28 variables ranging from information such as the director name, main actors and the number of likes that each actor has on Facebook, the movie budget, genre, etc. The objective of our project is to create a software that will take user inputs for a movie and return the result whether user should definitely watch or not. </p>
           <p>The main learning goals for this project is to use machine learning to come up with a methodology to predict future IMDb scores, which ties to utilization of Python to build predictive models for data analytics. Moreover, our group wanted to familiarize ourselves with different library packages that are essential to data analytics and understand the difficulty in creating accurate models for predictions, and what factors affect the accuracy. Overall, since this is software development class, we wanted to develop the software that can integrate the aspects of machine learning and software development.</p>

           <p>To filter, clean, and utilize the movies dataset to predict whether or not we recommend a user to watch a movie or not, we used Python packages including matplotlib, pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. We used matplotlib to visualize the dataset as a matrix plot, pandas to read the csv file and create dataframes, numpy to create arrays in the variables, and scikit-learn to test different statistical models. We used three predictive model algorithms including linear regression, logistic regression, and k-Nearest neighbors. We found that logistic regression returned the highest accuracy of approximately 67% with the following predictors: year, number of Facebook likes for the director, the first, second and third actors, the number of faces in the movie poster, content rating, budget and genre. Because our final predictive model utilizes a categorical response, we converted the movie ratings column:</p>
           <li>Bad - Not recommended (0 - 5)</li>
           <li>Good - Consider watching the movie (5 - 7)</li>
           <li>Excellent - Go watch it! (7 - 10)</li>
           <p>After building our final predictive model, we developed this software using Flask. We organized our code into three files that contains functions to clean and filter the data, predict the movie recommendation, and to suggest other movie recommendations based on user inputs. Our last file (website.py) calls the function from each of these and runs them together to deliver a prediction. </p>

           <p>Initially when we started this project, we were most concerned about how to clean and filter the data so that we can even begin to build a predictive model. Our dataset had 16 columns of 28 with missing values, with some columns as many as 500 missing values. We weighed the options: to delete all the records with missing values which would eliminate a lot of data, or to fill in the missing values with an average of the column which meant skewing the data - especially if the range is large. We proceeded with a combination of both. </p>
           <p>In addition, the predictor ‘genre’ was stored in concatenated form - multiple genres associated with a movie were stored in one cell. A few different ways we thought about proceeding were randomly picking one of the genres listed, selecting only the first one, or creating dummy variables for all the genres. After an exploration of Excel functions, we were able to convert a genre that looks like “[Action | Drama | Thriller]” into dummy variables.</p>
           <p>Lastly, we built our predictive model on the movies that were produced in year 2000 or after as well as in the English language to make the results more relevant to our interests. While we were coding the dataset, we came across a lot of unfamiliarities with the libraries used. For example, the concept of using a data frame and numpy array was new to us; thus when trying to simply prepare the data or building the model, we ran into numerous errors with the input type.</p>
           <p>Upon building a successful predictive model, we shifted our focus to building our software to recommend whether or not to view a movie given user inputs. Using flask and html template, we created a web page where users can input information on the movie they are interested in finding out the scores. After we retrieved the user input, we called in two functions to predict how good the movie is and recommend top 3 movies. </p>

           <p>Granted more time, we or other people could work on following extensions
           <li>Build the statistical models from scratch, without using scikit-learn</li>
           <li>Show how the predictions change using data visualization as a user changes predictors</li>
           <li>Extend code to be usable with other datasets</li>
           <li>Compare the significant predictors from different set of years (pre-2000 vs. post-2000)</li>
